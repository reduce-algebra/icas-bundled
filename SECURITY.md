# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Due to the nature of the software in this repository (scripts for **REDUCE**),
it is unlikely (but not impossible) that any security vulnerabilities exist.

However, if any are found that are **specific** to this package, they should
be reported upstream to [AL Software](http://alsoftiphone.com/).

Vulnerabilities in **REDUCE** should be reported via the
[REDUCE Bug Reporting and Ticketing System](https://sourceforge.net/p/reduce-algebra/bugs/);
please check "Mark as Private" when submitting the report.
